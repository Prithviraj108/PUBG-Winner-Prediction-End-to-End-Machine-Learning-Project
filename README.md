# PUBG-Winner-Prediction-End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Project
To predict the win percentage (winPlacePerc) of players in the popular battle royale game PUBG using machine learning models trained on in-game statistics.
Project Overview:
Dataset: Real match data from PUBG with various in-game performance metrics (e.g., kills, damage dealt, match duration, team placement, etc.).

Target Variable: winPlacePerc â€“ a normalized indicator of the final standing of a player in a match.

Goal: Build a regression model that can predict a player's likelihood of winning based on their performance features.

ðŸ§° Key Steps & Techniques:
âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Inspected missing values and data types.

Visualized target variable distribution using histograms.

Generated correlation heatmaps to identify influential features.

âœ… Data Preprocessing
Dropped irrelevant identifiers (Id, groupId, matchId).

One-hot encoded the matchType categorical column.

Applied the IQR method to detect and remove outliers.

Used StandardScaler to normalize feature values.

âœ… Modeling
Trained and evaluated multiple regression models:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

âœ… Model Evaluation
Performance assessed using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

Among all, XGBoost and Random Forest showed the best balance between accuracy and generalization.

ðŸ“ˆ Results & Insights:
Feature engineering (like outlier removal and one-hot encoding) significantly improved model performance.

Models trained on cleaned and scaled data outperformed baseline models.

Provided a practical approach to real-world regression problems in gaming analytics.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Jupyter Notebook
